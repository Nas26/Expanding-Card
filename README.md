# Quiz App

This app goes through different question sets. The user would be able to choose the correct answer. At the end, participants can see their results. If they're not satisfied with their record, they can retake the test. 


## troubleshooting
**problem**

During the running of the code, I realized that questions stay as default and are not changing. Also, the user wouldn't be able to retake the exam

**Solution**

I had to read the documents one more time. First I made sure the JavaScript code was correct. After carefully reading the script, I checked the HTML file to ensure id was correctly assigned. I realized that there were several syntax errors, after correctly misspelling, questions changed to new questions.
